# v0 â€” Mail

> Instead of starting new projects from the ground up, v0 takes commonly re-used frameworks, plugins, and design patterns and makes makes it easy to start new projects with these dependencies pre-included. It also speeds up development time and code consistency within and between projects by re-using common classes, naming conventions, patterns and [third party libraries](http://dijkstra.io/v0-mail/styleguide/libraries.html).
